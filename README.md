# Lyft Price Tracker

I commute to the same few locations with lyft and sometimes with my car. There were days and times where the price of a lyft ride would be a decent price and other times the price would be really high or really low. I decided to create an application that would continously gather the price of a lyft ride with a predetermined pickup and dropoff location. It would gather this data every couple hours, and upload this data to a database, where I could then observe the average price at a certain time of day, which days were the best to ride overall, etc.
